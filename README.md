Moonpig - Front-end submission by Ryan Holmes.

I built this using Next.js as this is what you seem to use from the job spec.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I also used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) css framwork, no particular reason just thought I would try this one out.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
